/**
 * Description
 * The GstVideoOverlay interface is used for 2 main purposes :
 * To get a grab on the Window where the video sink element is going to render.
 * This is achieved by either being informed about the Window identifier that
 * the video sink element generated, or by forcing the video sink element to use
 * a specific Window identifier for rendering.
 * To force a redrawing of the latest video frame the video sink element
 * displayed on the Window. Indeed if the GstPipeline is in GST_STATE_PAUSED
 * state, moving the Window around will damage its content. Application
 * developers will want to handle the Expose events themselves and force the
 * video sink element to refresh the Window's content.
 * Using the Window created by the video sink is probably the simplest scenario,
 * in some cases, though, it might not be flexible enough for application
 * developers if they need to catch events such as mouse moves and button
 * clicks.
 * Setting a specific Window identifier on the video sink element is the most
 * flexible solution but it has some issues. Indeed the application needs to set
 * its Window identifier at the right time to avoid internal Window creation
 * from the video sink element. To solve this issue a GstMessage is posted on
 * the bus to inform the application that it should set the Window identifier
 * immediately. Here is an example on how to do that correctly:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * <hr>
 * Two basic usage scenarios
 * There are two basic usage scenarios: in the simplest case, the application
 * knows exactly what particular element is used for video output, which is
 * usually the case when the application creates the videosink to use
 * (e.g. xvimagesink, ximagesink, etc.) itself; in this case, the application
 * can just create the videosink element, create and realize the window to
 * render the video on and then call gst_video_overlay_set_window_handle() directly
 * with the XID or native window handle, before starting up the pipeline.
 * In the other and more common case, the application does not know in advance
 * what GStreamer video sink element will be used for video output. This is
 * usually the case when an element such as autovideosink or gconfvideosink
 * is used. In this case, the video sink element itself is created
 * asynchronously from a GStreamer streaming thread some time after the
 * pipeline has been started up. When that happens, however, the video sink
 * will need to know right then whether to render onto an already existing
 * application window or whether to create its own window. This is when it
 * posts a prepare-window-handle message, and that is also why this message needs
 * to be handled in a sync bus handler which will be called from the streaming
 * thread directly (because the video sink will need an answer right then).
 * As response to the prepare-window-handle element message in the bus sync
 * handler, the application may use gst_video_overlay_set_window_handle() to tell
 * the video sink to render onto an existing window surface. At this point the
 * application should already have obtained the window handle / XID, so it
 * just needs to set it. It is generally not advisable to call any GUI toolkit
 * functions or window system functions from the streaming thread in which the
 * prepare-window-handle message is handled, because most GUI toolkits and
 * windowing systems are not thread-safe at all and a lot of care would be
 * required to co-ordinate the toolkit and window system calls of the
 * different threads (Gtk+ users please note: prior to Gtk+ 2.18
 * GDK_WINDOW_XID() was just a simple structure access, so generally fine to do
 * within the bus sync handler; this macro was changed to a function call in
 * Gtk+ 2.18 and later, which is likely to cause problems when called from a
 * sync handler; see below for a better approach without GDK_WINDOW_XID()
 * used in the callback).
