/**
 * Description
 * GstBin is an element that can contain other GstElement, allowing them to be
 * managed as a group.
 * Pads from the child elements can be ghosted to the bin, see GstGhostPad.
 * This makes the bin look like any other elements and enables creation of
 * higher-level abstraction elements.
 * A new GstBin is created with gst_bin_new(). Use a GstPipeline instead if you
 * want to create a toplevel bin because a normal bin doesn't have a bus or
 * handle clock distribution of its own.
 * After the bin has been created you will typically add elements to it with
 * gst_bin_add(). You can remove elements with gst_bin_remove().
 * An element can be retrieved from a bin with gst_bin_get_by_name(), using the
 * elements name. gst_bin_get_by_name_recurse_up() is mainly used for internal
 * purposes and will query the parent bins when the element is not found in the
 * current bin.
 * An iterator of elements in a bin can be retrieved with
 * gst_bin_iterate_elements(). Various other iterators exist to retrieve the
 * elements in a bin.
 * gst_object_unref() is used to drop your reference to the bin.
 * The "element-added" signal is fired whenever a new element is added to
 * the bin. Likewise the "element-removed" signal is fired whenever an
 * element is removed from the bin.
 * Notes
 * A GstBin internally intercepts every GstMessage posted by its children and
 * implements the following default behaviour for each of them:
 * GST_MESSAGE_EOS
 * This message is only posted by sinks in the PLAYING
 *  state. If all sinks posted the EOS message, this bin will post and EOS
 *  message upwards.
 * GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_START
 * just collected and never forwarded upwards.
 *  The messages are used to decide when all elements have completed playback
 *  of their segment.
 * GST_MESSAGE_SEGMENT_DONE
 *  Is posted by GstBin when all elements that posted
 *  a SEGMENT_START have posted a SEGMENT_DONE.
 * GST_MESSAGE_DURATION_CHANGED
 *  Is posted by an element that detected a change
 *  in the stream duration. The default bin behaviour is to clear any
 *  cached duration values so that the next duration query will perform
 *  a full duration recalculation. The duration change is posted to the
 *  application so that it can refetch the new duration with a duration
 *  query. Note that these messages can be posted before the bin is
 *  prerolled, in which case the duration query might fail.
 * GST_MESSAGE_CLOCK_LOST
 *  This message is posted by an element when it
 *  can no longer provide a clock. The default bin behaviour is to
 *  check if the lost clock was the one provided by the bin. If so and
 *  the bin is currently in the PLAYING state, the message is forwarded to
 *  the bin parent.
 *  This message is also generated when a clock provider is removed from
 *  the bin. If this message is received by the application, it should
 *  PAUSE the pipeline and set it back to PLAYING to force a new clock
 *  distribution.
 * GST_MESSAGE_CLOCK_PROVIDE
 *  This message is generated when an element
 *  can provide a clock. This mostly happens when a new clock
 *  provider is added to the bin. The default behaviour of the bin is to
 *  mark the currently selected clock as dirty, which will perform a clock
 *  recalculation the next time the bin is asked to provide a clock.
 *  This message is never sent tot the application but is forwarded to
 *  the parent of the bin.
 * OTHERS
 *  posted upwards.
 * A GstBin implements the following default behaviour for answering to a
 * GstQuery:
 * GST_QUERY_DURATION
 * If the query has been asked before with the same format
 *  and the bin is a toplevel bin (ie. has no parent),
 *  use the cached previous value. If no previous value was cached, the
 *  query is sent to all sink elements in the bin and the MAXIMUM of all
 *  values is returned. If the bin is a toplevel bin the value is cached.
 *  If no sinks are available in the bin, the query fails.
 * GST_QUERY_POSITION
 * The query is sent to all sink elements in the bin and the
 *  MAXIMUM of all values is returned. If no sinks are available in the bin,
 *  the query fails.
 * OTHERS
 * the query is forwarded to all sink elements, the result
 *  of the first sink that answers the query successfully is returned. If no
 *  sink is in the bin, the query fails.
 * A GstBin will by default forward any event sent to it to all sink elements.
 * If all the sinks return TRUE, the bin will also return TRUE, else FALSE is
 * returned. If no sinks are in the bin, the event handler will return TRUE.
