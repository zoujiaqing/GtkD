/**
 * Description
 * The event class provides factory methods to construct events for sending
 * and functions to query (parse) received events.
 * Events are usually created with gst_event_new_*() which takes event-type
 * specific parameters as arguments.
 * To send an event application will usually use gst_element_send_event() and
 * elements will use gst_pad_send_event() or gst_pad_push_event().
 * The event should be unreffed with gst_event_unref() if it has not been sent.
 * Events that have been received can be parsed with their respective
 * gst_event_parse_*() functions. It is valid to pass NULL for unwanted details.
 * Events are passed between elements in parallel to the data stream. Some events
 * are serialized with buffers, others are not. Some events only travel downstream,
 * others only upstream. Some events can travel both upstream and downstream.
 * The events are used to signal special conditions in the datastream such as
 * EOS (end of stream) or the start of a new stream-segment.
 * Events are also used to flush the pipeline of any pending data.
 * Most of the event API is used inside plugins. Applications usually only
 * construct and use seek events.
 * To do that gst_event_new_seek() is used to create a seek event. It takes
 * the needed parameters to specify seeking time and mode.
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)

	/**
	 * Allocate a new qos event with the given values.
	 * The QOS event is generated in an element that wants an upstream
	 * element to either reduce or increase its rate because of
	 * high/low CPU load or other resource usage such as network performance or
	 * throttling. Typically sinks generate these events for each buffer
	 * they receive.
	 * type indicates the reason for the QoS event. GST_QOS_TYPE_OVERFLOW is
	 * used when a buffer arrived in time or when the sink cannot keep up with
	 * the upstream datarate. GST_QOS_TYPE_UNDERFLOW is when the sink is not
	 * receiving buffers fast enough and thus has to drop late buffers.
	 * GST_QOS_TYPE_THROTTLE is used when the datarate is artificially limited
	 * by the application, for example to reduce power consumption.
	 * proportion indicates the real-time performance of the streaming in the
	 * element that generated the QoS event (usually the sink). The value is
	 * generally computed based on more long term statistics about the streams
	 * timestamps compared to the clock.
	 * A value < 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is producing data faster
	 * than real-time. A value > 1.0 indicates that the upstream element is not
	 * producing data fast enough. 1.0 is the ideal proportion value. The
	 * proportion value can safely be used to lower or increase the quality of
	 * the element.
	 * diff is the difference against the clock in running time of the last
	 * buffer that caused the element to generate the QOS event. A negative value
	 * means that the buffer with timestamp arrived in time. A positive value
	 * indicates how late the buffer with timestamp was. When throttling is
	 * enabled, diff will be set to the requested throttling interval.
	 * timestamp is the timestamp of the last buffer that cause the element
	 * to generate the QOS event. It is expressed in running time and thus an ever
	 * increasing value.
	 * The upstream element can use the diff and timestamp values to decide
	 * whether to process more buffers. For possitive diff, all buffers with
	 * timestamp <= timestamp + diff will certainly arrive late in the sink
	 * as well. A (negative) diff value so that timestamp + diff would yield a
	 * result smaller than 0 is not allowed.
	 * The application can use general event probes to intercept the QoS
	 * event and implement custom application specific QoS handling.
	 * Params:
	 * type = the QoS type
	 * proportion = the proportion of the qos message
