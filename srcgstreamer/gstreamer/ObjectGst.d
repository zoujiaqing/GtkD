/**
 * Description
 * GstObject provides a root for the object hierarchy tree filed in by the
 * GStreamer library. It is currently a thin wrapper on top of
 * GInitiallyUnowned. It is an abstract class that is not very usable on its own.
 * GstObject gives us basic refcounting, parenting functionality and locking.
 * Most of the function are just extended for special GStreamer needs and can be
 * found under the same name in the base class of GstObject which is GObject
 * (e.g. g_object_ref() becomes gst_object_ref()).
 * Since GstObject dereives from GInitiallyUnowned, it also inherits the
 * floating reference. Be aware that functions such as gst_bin_add() and
 * gst_element_add_pad() take ownership of the floating reference.
 * In contrast to GObject instances, GstObject adds a name property. The functions
 * gst_object_set_name() and gst_object_get_name() are used to set/get the name
 * of the object.
 * controlled properties
 * Controlled properties offers a lightweight way to adjust gobject
 * properties over stream-time. It works by using time-stamped value pairs that
 * are queued for element-properties. At run-time the elements continously pull
 * values changes for the current stream-time.
 * What needs to be changed in a GstElement?
 * Very little - it is just two steps to make a plugin controllable!
 *  mark gobject-properties paramspecs that make sense to be controlled,
 *  by GST_PARAM_CONTROLLABLE.
 *  when processing data (get, chain, loop function) at the beginning call
 *  gst_object_sync_values(element,timestamp).
 *  This will made the controller to update all gobject properties that are under
 *  control with the current values based on timestamp.
 * What needs to be done in applications?
 * Again it's not a lot to change.
 *  create a GstControlSource.
 *  csource = gst_interpolation_control_source_new();
 *  g_object_set (csource, "mode", GST_INTERPOLATION_MODE_LINEAR, NULL);
 *  Attach the GstControlSource on the controller to a property.
 *  gst_object_add_control_binding (object, gst_direct_control_binding_new (object, "prop1", csource));
 *  Set the control values
 *  gst_timed_value_control_source_set ((GstTimedValueControlSource *)csource,0 * GST_SECOND, value1);
 *  gst_timed_value_control_source_set ((GstTimedValueControlSource *)csource,1 * GST_SECOND, value2);
 *  start your pipeline
