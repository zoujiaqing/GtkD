/**
 * Description
 * A GstPipeline is a special GstBin used as the toplevel container for
 * the filter graph. The GstPipeline will manage the selection and
 * distribution of a global GstClock as well as provide a GstBus to the
 * application.
 * gst_pipeline_new() is used to create a pipeline. when you are done with
 * the pipeline, use gst_object_unref() to free its resources including all
 * added GstElement objects (if not otherwise referenced).
 * Elements are added and removed from the pipeline using the GstBin
 * methods like gst_bin_add() and gst_bin_remove() (see GstBin).
 * Before changing the state of the GstPipeline (see GstElement) a GstBus
 * can be retrieved with gst_pipeline_get_bus(). This bus can then be
 * used to receive GstMessage from the elements in the pipeline.
 * By default, a GstPipeline will automatically flush the pending GstBus
 * messages when going to the NULL state to ensure that no circular
 * references exist when no messages are read from the GstBus. This
 * behaviour can be changed with gst_pipeline_set_auto_flush_bus().
 * When the GstPipeline performs the PAUSED to PLAYING state change it will
 * select a clock for the elements. The clock selection algorithm will by
 * default select a clock provided by an element that is most upstream
 * (closest to the source). For live pipelines (ones that return
 * GST_STATE_CHANGE_NO_PREROLL from the gst_element_set_state() call) this
 * will select the clock provided by the live source. For normal pipelines
 * this will select a clock provided by the sinks (most likely the audio
 * sink). If no element provides a clock, a default GstSystemClock is used.
 * The clock selection can be controlled with the gst_pipeline_use_clock()
 * method, which will enforce a given clock on the pipeline. With
 * gst_pipeline_auto_clock() the default clock selection algorithm can be
 * restored.
 * A GstPipeline maintains a running time for the elements. The running
 * time is defined as the difference between the current clock time and
 * the base time. When the pipeline goes to READY or a flushing seek is
 * performed on it, the running time is reset to 0. When the pipeline is
 * set from PLAYING to PAUSED, the current clock time is sampled and used to
 * configure the base time for the elements when the pipeline is set
 * to PLAYING again. The effect is that the running time (as the difference
 * between the clock time and the base time) will count how much time was spent
 * in the PLAYING state. This default behaviour can be changed with the
 * gst_element_set_start_time() method.
