 * Description
 * The GStreamer core provides a GstSystemClock based on the system time.
 * Asynchronous callbacks are scheduled from an internal thread.
 * Clock implementors are encouraged to subclass this systemclock as it
 * implements the async notification.
 * Subclasses can however override all of the important methods for sync and
 * async notifications to implement their own callback methods or blocking
 * wait operations.
