/**
 * Description
 * GstTask is used by GstElement and GstPad to provide the data passing
 * threads in a GstPipeline.
 * A GstPad will typically start a GstTask to push or pull data to/from the
 * peer pads. Most source elements start a GstTask to push data. In some cases
 * a demuxer element can start a GstTask to pull data from a peer element. This
 * is typically done when the demuxer can perform random access on the upstream
 * peer element for improved performance.
 * Although convenience functions exist on GstPad to start/pause/stop tasks, it
 * might sometimes be needed to create a GstTask manually if it is not related to
 * a GstPad.
 * Before the GstTask can be run, it needs a GStaticRecMutex that can be set with
 * gst_task_set_lock().
 * The task can be started, paused and stopped with gst_task_start(), gst_task_pause()
 * and gst_task_stop() respectively or with the gst_task_set_state() function.
 * A GstTask will repeatedly call the GstTaskFunction with the user data
 * that was provided when creating the task with gst_task_new(). While calling
 * the function it will acquire the provided lock. The provided lock is released
 * when the task pauses or stops.
 * Stopping a task with gst_task_stop() will not immediately make sure the task is
 * not running anymore. Use gst_task_join() to make sure the task is completely
 * stopped and the thread is stopped.
 * After creating a GstTask, use gst_object_unref() to free its resources. This can
 * only be done when the task is not running anymore.
 * Task functions can send a GstMessage to send out-of-band data to the
 * application. The application can receive messages from the GstBus in its
 * mainloop.
 * For debugging purposes, the task will configure its object name as the thread
 * name on Linux. Please note that the object name should be configured before the
 * task is started; changing the object name after the task has been started, has
 * no effect on the thread name.
