/**
 * Description
 * GStreamer is a framework for constructing graphs of various filters
 * (termed elements here) that will handle streaming media. Any discreet
 * (packetizable) media type is supported, with provisions for automatically
 * determining source type. Formatting/framing information is provided with
 * a powerful negotiation framework. Plugins are heavily used to provide for
 * all elements, allowing one to construct plugins outside of the GST
 * library, even released binary-only if license require (please don't).
 * GStreamer covers a wide range of use cases including: playback, recording,
 * editing, serving streams, voice over ip and video calls.
 * The GStreamer library should be initialized with
 * gst_init() before it can be used. You should pass pointers to the main argc
 * and argv variables so that GStreamer can process its own command line
 * options, as shown in the following example.
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * It's allowed to pass two NULL pointers to gst_init() in case you don't want
 * to pass the command line args to GStreamer.
 * You can also use GOption to initialize your own parameters as shown in
 * the next code fragment:
 * $(DDOC_COMMENT example)
 * Use gst_version() to query the library version at runtime or use the
 * GST_VERSION_* macros to find the version at compile time. Optionally
 * gst_version_string() returns a printable string.
 * The gst_deinit() call is used to clean up all internal resources used
 * by GStreamer. It is mostly used in unit tests
 * to check for leaks.
 * Last reviewed on 2006-08-11 (0.10.10)
